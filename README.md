# Adaptive normalization experiments

This respository contains code accompanying the paper "[Adaptive normalization for IPW estimation](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jci-2022-0019/html)". The correspondence between the code here and the results in the paper is:

- `estimators.R` contains implementations of all estimators discussed 
- `optimization.R` reproduces Figure 1 in the main text 
- `iterative_variance.R` reproduces Figure 2 in the main text 
- `swiss_municipalities.R` reproduces Table 1 in the main text
- `ate_comparison_normal.R` and `ate_comparison_power.R` reproduce Figures 3 and A3 in the main text and appendix, depending on the set of estimators selected 
- `coverage.R` reproduces Figure 4 in the main text
- `policy_evaluation.R` reproduces Table 2 in the main text
- `swiss_municipalities_optimization.R` reproduces Figure A1 in the appendix 
- `overlap_bias.R` reproduces Figure A2 in the appendix
